        “The opportunity for every child to learn and to make the most of their talents is at the heart of a fairer society. <br>Yet in country after country it is wealth, not talent, that dictates a child’s educational destiny.… This reality is failing individual children, each of whom has a right to education. <br>It is also failing society, as a generation of talented poor girls and boys cannot fulfil their promise and contribute fully to human progress. <br>Brilliant doctors, teachers or entrepreneurs are instead herding goats or collecting water. Humanity faces unprecedented challenges. <br>Yet instead of utilizing the talents of all of people, inequality means we are squandering this potential.”
